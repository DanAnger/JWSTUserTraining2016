# User Training in JWST Data Analysis II

The second ["User Training in JWST Data
Analysis"](https://jwst.stsci.edu/events/events-area/stsci-events-listing-container/user-training-in-jwst-data-analysis-ii)
workshop will be held on November 8-11, 2016 at the Space Telescope
Science Institute (STScI).  The purpose of this three-day meeting is
to provide training in the the open-source data analysis tools being
developed at STScI for use with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST),
as well as for many other optical/IR observatories.

The meeting will include an optional training day (Day Zero) on
November 8 to provide novice participants an introduction to Python
and Astropy.

This will be an interactive workshop so be sure to come with a laptop
with a reasonably up-to-date Python distribution.  If you're not sure
what this might mean, we recommend you install the [Anaconda python
distribution](https://anaconda.org), and add the astroconda repository
maintained by STScI on top of that.  Full instructions for this can be
found at http://astroconda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.
